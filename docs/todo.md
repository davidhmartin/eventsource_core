# Event Sourcing Framework Development Tasks

## 1. Core Domain Components
- [X] Implement base `Aggregate` class
  - State management
  - Event application logic
  - Version tracking
- [X] Complete base `Event` and `Command` interfaces
  - Add validation methods
  - Implement serialization support
- [X] Create `AggregateStore`
  - Implement snapshot integration
  - Add event replay functionality
  - Handle aggregate reconstruction

## 2. Command Processing
- [X] Implement `CommandHandler` base class
  - Add validation infrastructure
  - Error handling patterns
- [X] Build `CommandProcessor` with queue
  - Command serialization
  - Concurrent command handling
  - Error recovery

## 3. Infrastructure
- [ ] Additional Event Store Backends
  - PostgreSQL implementation
  - MongoDB implementation
  - In-memory store for testing
- [ ] Event Serialization
  - JSON serialization helpers
  - Custom type serialization support
  - Schema versioning support
- [ ] Concurrency Control
  - Optimistic concurrency in stores
  - Conflict resolution strategies
  - Version conflict handling

## 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Aggregate Testing Helpers
  - Given/When/Then test patterns
  - Event stream builders
  - State verification utilities
- [ ] Integration Test Suite
  - End-to-end command processing
  - Store implementation tests
  - Concurrency tests
- [ ] Example Implementations
  - Sample aggregates
  - Common command patterns
  - Test scenarios

## 5. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] API Documentation
  - Interface documentation
  - Implementation guides
  - Best practices
- [ ] Example Projects
  - Basic CRUD example
  - Complex domain example
  - Integration patterns
- [ ] Usage Guidelines
  - Event design patterns
  - Aggregate design
  - Command handling patterns

## 6. Performance and Monitoring
- [ ] Metrics Collection
  - Command processing times
  - Event store performance
  - Snapshot efficiency
- [ ] Store Optimization
  - Event store indexing
  - Snapshot strategies
  - Query optimization
- [ ] Production Monitoring
  - Health check endpoints
  - Performance logging
  - Error tracking

## Notes
- Priority should be given to core domain components as they are fundamental to the framework
- Each component should have comprehensive tests before moving to the next
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
